# MotorLibrary


* Library to control a Motor with L293D
* Developed by Salim Khazem



It is a library that allows you to control an Motor using an L293D

You must add the libraries to the Arduino libraries folder. 

To do this : you must copy the folder "Motor" paste them in the arduino libraries folder.



I used an example with the inertial unit MPU6050, I put it in the folder ../Motor/examples



Operation:

* To include the library you have to include the Motor library and this is done with this formula #include <Motor.h>

* To create an instance: Motor object (pin1, pin2, pinPWM);

* For the assignment it is necessary to introduce: object.begin ();

* To run the engine in the forward direction: object.forward (speed_with_percentage);

* To run the engine in the reverse direction: object.rearward (speed_with_percentage);

* To stop the engine: object.turnOff ();
