# MotorLibrary


* Library to control a Motor with L293D
* Developed by Salim Khazem



It is a library that allows you to control an Motor using an L293D

You must add the libraries to the Arduino libraries folder. 

To do this : you must copy the folder "Motor" paste them in the arduino libraries folder.



I used an example with the inertial unit MPU6050, I put it in the folder ../Motor/examples
